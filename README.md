## COMP3311 Database Management Systems - Assignment 4

Assignment involved building a webpage in C# with options to run parameterised SQL queries. Tabular data given was inconsistent with relational schema (some attributes have different names), therefore I used \texttt{pandas} in \texttt{3311_load_data.ipynb} to produce the correct .csv files.
